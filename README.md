## 📱 Overview

CashewVision analyzes cashew kernel images and generates:

- Quality grading (W320, W240, etc.)
- Defect detection
- Batch analytics
- Export quality assessment
- Factory dashboard insights
- AI-generated summaries & certificates

The application combines **computer vision + prompt engineering + LLM reasoning** to simulate expert-level grading.

## 🏭 Problem Addressed

Cashew factories rely heavily on manual grading which causes:

- Inconsistent quality assessment
- High labor dependency
- Export disputes
- Slow batch inspection
- Lack of digital traceability

CashewVision introduces **AI-assisted standardized grading**.

Built for: IEDC Kollam Cluster Level Hackathon
Theme: CashewTech & Food Processing

CashewVision was developed as a working prototype addressing real-world challenges in cashew processing industries, including automated grading, batch quality analytics, and AI-assisted inspection.

Unlike many concept-only submissions, this project included:
	•	A functional mobile application
	•	AI-based grading workflow
	•	Batch analysis dashboard
	•	Digital certification system
	•	Working prototype demonstration

Although the project was **not shortlisted for the final round**, **the experience highlighted an important insight — advanced AI-driven industrial solutions can sometimes be challenging to evaluate within traditional judging frameworks. Many evaluation systems are still evolving to fully recognize software-first and AI-native innovations, especially those focused on intelligent automation rather than hardware prototypes**.

As industries increasingly move toward AI-assisted decision systems, modern solutions like CashewVision represent a shift from manual or hardware-centric innovation to data-driven and software-defined intelligence. This project reflects that transition, demonstrating how mobile AI and vision-language models can address real industrial problems through scalable digital approaches.   

## 📌 Project Status

CashewVision is a completed prototype project developed for the IEDC Kollam Cluster Level Hackathon under the CashewTech theme.

The application successfully demonstrates AI-assisted cashew grading, batch quality analytics, and digital certification concepts. While active development is not currently planned, the project remains available as a proof-of-concept showcasing the potential of AI-driven automation in the cashew processing industry.

This repository is maintained for learning, research reference, and portfolio purposes.
